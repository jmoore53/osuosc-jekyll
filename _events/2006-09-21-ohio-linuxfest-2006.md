On September 30, 2006 [Ohio LinuxFest 2006](http://www.ohiolinux.org) will occur at the [Greater Columbus Convention Center](http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend_travel.html). This event will draw over a dozen sponsors, twenty speakers, and nearly two-thousand attendees.

The Open Source Club is proud to once again play a part in an event which began on The Ohio State University campus. As a .org level sponsor, we will be attending and manning our own booth this year. We will draw up plans for our booth once the date draws closer. What is important now is for everyone who wished to attend to [register](http://www.ohiolinux.org/attend.html) on the official Ohio LinuxFest 2006 website **before Friday, September 22 2006**. Registration is strictly limited to 1,968 attendees, so it is in your best interest to register _now_.

This year Ohio LinuxFest is offering two conference passes. The first option is the _Free Conference Pass_, which offers access to the presentations and expo. The second option is a new _All Conference Pass_, which in addition to the presentations and expo includes the following:

*   Access to the Conference Suite at the Holiday Inn
*   Lunch on the Day of the Conference
*   Drink tickets for the After Conference Party
*   An Ohio Linuxfest T-Shirt
*   Rockstar Style Backstage Pass

The cost of the All Conference Pass is $65.00, which goes only into defraying the cost of running Ohio LinuxFest.

You can find more information about Ohio LinuxFest 2006 on their [offical website](http://www.ohiolinux.org), including the [List of speakers](http://www.ohiolinux.org/speakers.html) and the [conference schedule](http://www.ohiolinux.org/schedule.html).
