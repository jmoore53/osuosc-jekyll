Our last meeting (Nov 15) was about the Open Handset Alliance's Android. A
mobile operation system and application stack. We had a demo with the Hello
World and spent a lot of the time playing with the emulator prototype. Because
I feel this is a very interesting development, I personally will be working on
creating some apps for the platform. In addition, Google has $10M in prizes for
developers who create interesting new applications for this platform.
