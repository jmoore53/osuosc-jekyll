title: Forums are back online!
---
After months of returning error messages to users who went to
opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum, the [Open Source Club forums](http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum "Click here to enter our forums")
are back online. This past summer, p0rn and pharmaceutical spammers had a
field day, then our website got taken offline and we had to disable forums and
comments. We have cleaned up some lingering spam comments, re-enabled the forum,
and added a captcha requirement in order for anyone to log in, as well as a few
other random things. Spamming in the forums will absolutely not be tolerated. If
you find any spam on this site, please report it [here](http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/forum/21)
and a moderator will delete it and block/delete the offending user's account.

For the time being, only *.edu e-mail addresses may register* but if you have a
current account with another address that you already registered then it should
still be active. If you do not have a `.edu` address and would like access to
the forum, you can [contact me](http://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/contact "Contact us")
or another administrator telling us your e-mail address before you try to create
the account so we can authorize it. *Please* only do this if you do not have a
`.edu` address. Otherwise, we ask that you use your school address for
registering. We use this to keep track of users (e.g. someone with a
`name.#@osu.edu` is less likely to be a spammer than `admin@viagra.com` or
`cmbb@dbx.hk`) and to restrict spammers from creating accounts just to hose
the page with inappropriate content.
