We are currently having some problems with our content managing system, Drupal,
so changes here will be limited. We apologize for the inconvenience, and a group
of us are working hard on the issue, despite limitations such as not having
physical access to our server. We expect to have the site fully functional by
the end of this summer, possibly with some great new features for active members.
We are planning a great number of projects this year (some of which may be aided
by our server), more than we've had for a long time. Details are still pending
and yet to be revealed, so stay tuned, and expect dramatic changes to our website.

The Open Source Club welcomes members of all backgrounds, from freshmen who are
curious about open source software, to veteran Linux/Unix users and developers
out of graduate school. Come find us at the involvement fair on The Oval just
before school starts and learn what we're all about.
