title: Introduction to Linux
---
This Thursday, at 7:00 pm in [Dreese Labs](http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279) room 266, we will run through an introduction to Linux, in a way that any computer user - new or veteran - can understand. Some basic points to be discussed are:

- What is Linux?
- What does Linux do?
- Why is Linux better than Windows (or why not)?
- Who does Linux appeal to?
- What are some of the advantages/disadvantages of using Linux?
- What features does Linux have?

If time permits we plan on discussing how one picks a [Linux distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution), running a LiveCD, and running through the installation procedure, also covering some of the more advanced setups like setting up a computer so it can run both Windows and Linux (with a menu at startup asking which one you want), how to mount directories, and what to do if Windows gobbles up your Master Boot Record (MBR) making Linux unbootable.
