This Thursday's meeting (October 16<sup>th</sup> in [Dreese Labs](http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279), room 266) will include a presentation on source control management. The main tool that will be used is Mercurial, however most of what is shown can be applied to many of the other source control management tools. When you are working by yourself on really small programs, like the ones you do in CSE 221,222,321, then you can get away with not using any source control tools. However, real-world projects involve lots of different files and are worked on by many people that are located in different places-- and this is why it's important to understand how to use a source control management tool. As usual the meeting will be at 7:00 pm in Dreese Labs room 266\. The meeting is open to anyone who wants to learn about source control management. After the presentation we will try to work on getting a project started since we haven't done so yet.
