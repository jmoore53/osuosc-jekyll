Fun and merriment has ensued during this week's meeting as we explored scripting,
hacking, and otherwise misusing the Unix shell with Jim Dinan. Topic were
focused on bash, and included:

- Comparison of different shells
- The Linux file system, links, inodes, and file pwnership
- Input/Output between files and commands
- Variable setting, referencing, and changing
- Executing commands and files (with proper permissions)
