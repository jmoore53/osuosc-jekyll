This Thursday [3/5/09], brought to you by Alek Rollyson, we talked about certain important internet related topics. How does one go to work without leaving his house? How does one completely mask himself to the internet? How does one hide his traffic from *even his own ISP*? All of these are accomplished by what we discussed. Specifically we talked about (and covered to some extent):

- Internet privacy, the cute little paradox
- SSH Tunneling
  - How (and why) to use DD-WRT for a nice little SSH tunnel
- Proxies: TOR, SOCKS, etc.
- VPN
