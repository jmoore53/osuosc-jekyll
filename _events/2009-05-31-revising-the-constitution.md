This Thursday, June 4<sup>th</sup>, the Open Source Club leaders for the 2009-2010 school year will be discussing changes for the following year. All club members are strongly encouraged to use this opportunity to give their feedback about how the next year should be run.

First on the list is revising the [constitution](/history/2014/03/28/constitution/). Members can [register](/user/register)/[login](/user) and post their views/concerns/opinions about the constitution and potential changes in the forum thread located [here](/node/84). We are also discussing what the [new website](/node/87) should look like as well as other [general club-related concerns](/forum/6).

While for the past year comments/forums have been disabled, and prior to that users were required to have an administrator personally verify the account before they could post, any newly registering user or previously registered user should now be able to comment, even if they received [a message](/get_verified) that they were unverified.
