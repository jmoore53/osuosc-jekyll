This week Alek will be giving an introduction to Linux and an overview a good chunk of the Linux distributions that one has to choose from. We will go over all the pros, cons, features, strengths, setup nuances, requirements, and finally how to pick the perfect distro for your needs. After the overview we will then run through a graphical install of Ubuntu and then a text based install of Debian in order to both show the differences between the distributions and how text and graphical installs differ. Our meeting will be on Thursday October 1st in Dreese Labs room 266 and, as always, the meeting is open to everyone. We especially welcome newcomers to this meeting so we can introduce you to the world of Linux and how to get started! Bring any questions you have and we will be happy to answer. Attached below are the presentation slides from this meeting. There is both an OpenDocument format and a Microsoft Powerpoint format. Enjoy!
