On Thursday October 29th, 2009, at 7PM in Dreese Labs room 266, we will be presenting on how to configure the Linux kernel. If you have ever been lost when trying to compile or make menuconfig just confused you so much that you wanted to pull your hair out, then this meeting is for you. A few of our members will be making a collaborative effort on this topic so bring your questions to us and we will do our best to help. We will be going over how to compile a kernel the Debian way, the Gentoo way, and we also will be giving a general overview of the process as a whole so that it can be better understood. Bring your questions and concerns, we will be happy to address them.
