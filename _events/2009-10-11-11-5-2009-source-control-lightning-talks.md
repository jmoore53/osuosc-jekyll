On Thursday November 5th, 2009, we will be holding a lightning talk session on a multitude of different source control programs. Lightning talks will consist of several different presentations by different presenters over the course of the meeting time. We will put more info on here about how long the meeting will last and how many presentations there will be once we get more info on who wants to present on what topics.

Here are the topics that have been picked:

*   Git
*   SVN
*   Bazaar

In Brian Kennedy's Bazaar talk, he showed a quick reference sheet, the newest version of which should be available [here](http://doc.bazaar-vcs.org/latest/en/quick-reference/index.html).
