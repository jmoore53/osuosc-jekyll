Lightning talks will consist of several different presentations by different presenters over the course of the meeting time.

Here are the topics that have been picked thus far:

*   LaTeX
*   Wifi Auditing

*   iptables

Here are some suggested topics that you could possibly volunteer for:

*   Version Control
*   Overclocking
*   Regular Expressions
*   IRC
*   Any other cool stuff you can come up with
