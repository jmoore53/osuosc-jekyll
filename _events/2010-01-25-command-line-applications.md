This Thursday, March 11th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, we will be holding a lightning talk session covering a multitude of command line applications. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. If you are looking for a lightweight program to get the job done and don't need a graphical interface, be it checking your mail, downloading torrents, chatting on irc, editing text, or anything else, this is definitely the meeting for you. If you have found a command line program that has grasped your interest, consider coming in and sharing with the rest of the club as we are all looking for the next best thing. A current list of programs that are going to be covered is in a list below:

*   tmux
*   screen
*   mplayer
*   htop
*   multitail
*   mutt
*   pal
*   ii
*   ssh/sftp/scp
*   irssi
*   nano
*   wicd-curses
*   sshfs
*   yes
*   shred
*   wipe
*   cmus
*   Music Player Daemon and clients
*   nmap
*   chmod
*   fdisk and cfdisk

If you are interested in presenting, send an email to Alek Rollyson (rollyson.3 at osu.edu) or Matt Meinwald (meinwald.1 at osu.edu) and we will help you arrange to speak about your favorite cli program.
