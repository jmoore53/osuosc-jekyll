This Thursday January 28th, at 7PM in Dreese Labs 266, Morgan Goose will be showing off a multitude of GNU Utilties. Here is Morgan's synopsis of his talk:

This presentation is going to try and cover a lot of ground, and at variable speed. I am trying to get it into two somewhat logical parts.

First being where I into regex then show its use with sed. Then go into using awk, and finally how to use find.

The second half will try and touch on the rest of the commands, concentrating on grep, xargs, and process management.

I also will leave off with a slide or two of fun one liners, and some bash tricks, that people may find super useful.

*   find
*   lsof
*   netstat
