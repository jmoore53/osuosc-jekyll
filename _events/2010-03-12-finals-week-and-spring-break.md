type: "Meeting"
title: Finals Week and Spring Break
---
We will **NOT** be having a meeting Thursday, March 18 or March 25, because it is finals week and spring break. Our next meeting will be Thursday, April 1.

If you are looking for something to do over spring break, you can help with our [club projects](/projects) or the various free/open source [projects](/git) some of our members are working on. If you are interested, and don't know who to talk to, you can always email support@opensource.osu.edu and we will forward your email on to the right people.
