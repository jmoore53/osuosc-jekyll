This **Thursday, April 8th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,** we will be holding a lightning talk session focusing on programming languages. It came to our attention that knowledge of different languages was fragmented amongst meeting goers so we decided that we should each take turns introducing each other to languages that we have learned and think others would appreciate or find useful. The lightning talk format consists of short talks that each focus on a single topic and are typically given by multiple presenters in succession. Thus far we have had volunteers for the following languages:

*   C
*   Bash
*   C++
*   Java
*   Javascript
*   Lisp
*   Perl
*   PHP
*   Python
*   Ruby

I will be attaching demos and slides from the talks as they are available, so check back.
