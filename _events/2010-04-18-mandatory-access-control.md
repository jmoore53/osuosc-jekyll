This **Thursday, May 13th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,** Daniel Thau will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a demonstration will be given to show how one would go about locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.
