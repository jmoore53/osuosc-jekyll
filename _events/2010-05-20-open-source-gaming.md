title: Open Source Gaming

This **Thursday, May 20th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305,** we will be discussing open source gaming, gaming on Linux, gaming with [WINE](http://www.winehq.org/about/), and just general options for gaming once you switch to an open source operating system. One complaint that seems common in the open source OS world is that gaming is pretty much thrown out the window once you have made the switch. We would like to spend the meeting debunking this myth and showing all of the options that one has in the open source gaming arena. We will be showing pure open source games, games that you probably didn't know ran natively in Linux, and how gaming in [WINE](http://www.winehq.org/about/) has improved by leaps and bounds recently and actually does a relatively good job with some of our beloved games that only work on Windows. So come on out and join the discussion and hopefully learn how you are not totally hopeless gaming wise when switching to an open source operating system!

This Meeting is in preparation for our LAN party that we are hosting Saturday, May 22nd! There will be more information provided at the meeting and you can join our [announcement mailing list](http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce) for up to date information, or check the [wiki](/lan)!
