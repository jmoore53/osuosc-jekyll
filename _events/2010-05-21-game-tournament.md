On Saturday, May 22 in the Ohio Union, the Ohio State Open Source Club will be hosting a LAN Party from 10 AM Saturday morning until 3 AM Sunday morning. Per our Free and open source philosophy, we will be promoting games that either run natively in Linux or run well in WINE and, while some of the games themselves might not be free or open source in nature, we would like to show how gaming in Linux is not a lost cause. We will be providing a venue for people to come out and play the following computer games:

*   Quake 3
*   Quake Live
*   Starcraft and Starcraft: Brood War
*   Any game that runs natively in Linux (one of us will surely play and we are always looking for good F/OSS games)
*   If you're not sure whether a game runs in WINE or natively on Linux, bring it out and we will investigate together!

**We will be providing pizza around lunch and dinner times as well as limited amounts of soft drinks (Coke products of course).** This is an open event so anyone and everyone are welcome, including users of all operating systems of course (these games run just fine in Windows), we are just trying to show how Linux users are not stuck when it comes to gaming. Even if you have never played any of these games, but just like gaming, come on out and we will show you the ropes! We will be posting more information about the LAN party as time draws closer and you will be able to find and receive up-to-date information in the following two ways: The LAN Party wiki: http://opensource.osu.edu/lan And/Or you can join our announcement list to get information as it is released: http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource-announce The LAN Party is tentatively being held in the Ohio Union Creative Arts room but this is subject to change, you will be able to get up-to-date information through the channels listed above.
