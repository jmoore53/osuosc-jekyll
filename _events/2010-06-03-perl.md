This Thursday, June 3rd at 7PM in Dreese Labs 305, Robert Joseph will be presenting on the scripting language Perl.  This timing fits nicely because the Open Source Club is hosting Yet Another Perl Conference::North America 2010 later this month and we felt it was appropriate that we should prepare ourselves.  More info will be posted soon.
