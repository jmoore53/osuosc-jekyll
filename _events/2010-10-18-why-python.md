type: "Meeting"
title: Why Python?
---
This meeting will focus on several aspects of Python that don't normally come up in normal Python meetings. It will show you how things can be easier and more fun in Python! I will will be covering things from as simply as handling basic data types to more advance things such as making system calls or making the most of the PSL (Python Standard Library).

This meeting will also attempt to cover a small comparison between the larger more known languages: Java and C++, and show how some things can be done easier and quicker than in Java or C++.

If you have no idea what I am talking about, still stop by and maybe you'll finally take that small leap into the programming world.
