This Thursday, October 28 at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as "This Week in Slashdot". [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website that deals in news for the nerdy, specifically "stuff that matters". Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read Slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. This may be Alex's last quarter at Ohio State, so don't miss this meeting! It should also be noted that award certificates will be given out to those who can show that they've received a comment moderated 3 or better within the last week! There will also be candy tossed out for valuable participation in the discussions during the meeting.
