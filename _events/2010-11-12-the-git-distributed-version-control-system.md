type: "Meeting"
title: The Git Distributed Version Control System
---
This **Friday**, November 12th at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Git, a distributed version control system with a focus on performance and integrity. Despite being known as one of the more difficult VCSs to grasp, git has become quite popular and has a fair number of recognizable F/OSS projects using it, such as the Linux Kernel and X.org. Daniel will cover a quick history of Git (lots of tasty drama), cover some pros and cons of using Git, explain what Git is doing under the hood, give a conceptual explanation of what Git does, and of course go over both basic (add, commit, branch, merge, etc) and advanced (stash, rebase, etc) Git usage. Having a laptop with Git installed may be benficial for those in the audience who want to play along, but those without should be perfectly fine. NOTE: Due to veterans day this meeting is on a Friday, not a Thursday!
