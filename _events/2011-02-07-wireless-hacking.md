title: Wireless Hacking
---
Tonight at 7 pm in [Dreese Labs](http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279) room 264, I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering various sub-topics to wireless hacking, however the main point that I want people to take away from this talk is how to secure your own wireless network from these types of attacks. I'll be covering a brief outline on how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to **try** to protect your network. I'll be demonstrating these attacks as well, and I'll be needing help in this endeavor and I encourage people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I'm bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I'm giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types or security implementations that I will be covering. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be interesting!

DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are **NOT** responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very **easily** accessible on the Internet. I'm asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. I know this is late notice but it won't take more than a few minutes of your time. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I'll be doing you'll need a laptop with Linux.

There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and "john the ripper."

Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it's available in Ubuntu's and Fedora's repositories. However, for "john the ripper" you'll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz

More information in general about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/

If you want walk through what I'll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC and we'll help you out.
