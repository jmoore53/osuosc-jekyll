On Thursday, February 24, at 7PM in Dreese 264, Sogeti USA developers Jackie Gleason and Robert Omalley will discuss Android for beginning to intermediate Java developers.

After an introduction to Sogeti and possible careers, the beginning of the presentation is a "What is Android?" section where Jackie and Robert will talk about the history of android, what the current environment is like, and what to look forward to in the future. Next they will talk a little more in depth about how Android works from a software perspective (topics here include SDK, NDK, and getting it up and running on eclipse). Next they will explain the core objects (Resources, Activities, Threads and Processes) and interprocess communication (Content Providers, Broadcast Recievers, and Services). Finally there will be a little section on other cool up and coming techs related to Android Development.
