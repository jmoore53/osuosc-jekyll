UPE and ACM-W have once again invited us to a quiz bowl competition. On Wednesday, April 20, at 6:30 PM in Lazenby 021, teams of students and faculty will be competing to answer computer science-related questions, perhaps with a few other topics occasionally mixed in. This time, people will be choosing their own teams. You can sign up your team in the CSE advising office on the third floor of Dreese.
