This Thursday, May 5th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau and Alek Rollyson will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.
