As of 11:42 AM on Saturday, October 1^st , our SSL certificate will
expire. We are in the process of requesting a certificate from a new
and more trustworthy certificate authority, and have been for the past
month. The expired certificate will not be renewed. However, due to
circumstances beyond our control, we cannot have the new certificate
deployed until Monday, October 3^rd .

This means whenever you visit our website over a secure connection,
you will receive a warning from your web browser that the certificate
is "invalid" because it expired. This does not in any way mean your
connection to our website (or mail server) is compromised, and it's
only a temporary issue. If you do not feel comfortable proceeding to
connect to our server with these security warnings, you should wait
until sometime Monday when we have the new certificate deployed. We
apologize for the inconvenience.
