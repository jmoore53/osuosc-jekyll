title: Regular Expressions
---
October 27th at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Regular Expressions. Regular Expressions is a system for pattern recognition in text which is extremely useful for text processing. This talk may be especially appealing to up-and-coming *nix admins, since such systems rely heavily on text for things like configuration, but should be useful for anyone interested in software. The talk will mostly use examples with the grep and sed utilities, which are almost certainly already installed on your Linux or OSX laptops if you're bringing one along. If you're bringing a Windows laptop, grabbing Windows versions of such utilities (or Cygwin, or Linux in a VM) may be useful if you want to play along, but shouldn't be required to benefit from the talk.
