title: This Week in Slashdot
---
This Thursday, in [Dreese Labs](http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279) room 266, Alex Lingo will host his infamous _This Week in Slashdot_â„¢ discussion. As is the general format, Alex will display and discuss major events in technology, with feedback from the audience. For the uninitiated, [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) (often abbreviated **/.**) is a nerd-oriented news website where the readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and then published on the front page, with a new page typically appearing every couple of hours. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article, by posting comments. These comments are then [moderated](http://slashdot.org/moderation.shtml) by a randomly selected group of readers who can each add or subtract points from a limited number of comments for being funny/insightful/informative or offtopic/troll/flamebait, leaving only the highest rated comments immediately visible below the summary, often collectively making for a better read than the original article. Alex's discussion will attempt to mimic this format, and provoke civilized (yeah right!) discussion and debate about news topics that matter to nerds.
