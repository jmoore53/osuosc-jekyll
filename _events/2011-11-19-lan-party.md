title: LAN Party
---
Saturday, November 19th from 10:30AM-11:30PM (yes, 13 hours!) in the Ohio Union Interfaith Prayer and Reflection, the Open Source Club will be hosting a LAN party!

We will be focusing on open source gaming, but those with proprietary games on proprietary platforms will be welcome as well.  For more information, see http://opensource.osu.edu/lan

Don't forget to bring your own computer, ethernet cable and surge protector.

Hope to see you there!
