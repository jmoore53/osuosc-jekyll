Thursday, December 1st at 7:00PM in Dreese room 266, a number of our members will be presenting on various Open Source Operating Systems.  These will not be overly in-depth as some of our past presentations have been; rather, these should just taste of what these Operating Systems are like or why people may be interested in learning more about them.

Additionally, we will plan out the topics for our meetings quarter. Bring ideas both for what you can present on, what you would like other people to present on, and topics for meetings which aren't necessarily going to be structured as presentations.
