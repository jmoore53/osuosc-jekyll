title: Distributed Version Control Systems
---
January 5th, 2012 at 7:00PM in Dreese 266, Paul Schwendenman, Meisam Fathi Salmi and Daniel Thau will be giving presentations on Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS).  DVCSs are distributed systems which keep track of software revisions.  These are usually, but not necessarily, used to manage programming projects.  Daniel will go over the idea behind a DVCS, as well as some of the stuff going on under the hood in one of them (git).  Meisam will continue presenting on git, going over things such as the git commands, config file, hooks, and daemon.  Paul will present on Bazaar, another DVCS.
