I've recently revamped my Haskell Presentation. It should flow
significantly smoother than its previous incarnations. This will be the
first of a series of Haskell talks. The series should cover a wide breadth
of material at a fairly deep level. This will be the basic introduction to
programming in Haskell.

The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:
