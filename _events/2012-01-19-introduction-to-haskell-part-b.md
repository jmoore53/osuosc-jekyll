Following up the craziness from last week's Introduction to Haskell, I will
be presenting some more advanced stuff. I will begin by reviewing some of
the things from the end of last week's talk for those who left early or
burned their brain out. I will show you some practical code using only the
tools we've learned so far and then some of the abstractions that Haskell
uses.

For those of you who couldn't make it last week, we covered most* of the
material up to and including Chapter 6 of Learn You A
Haskell<http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters>.
The topics in Chapter 6 will probably receive some attention again before
moving onto the other topics.

The Haskell interpreter (ghci) is a great help in learning how things work.
If you want to follow along Thursday night, you should download the Haskell
Platform for your favorite operating system:

*most: I did not cover List Comprehensions and did not go into as much
depth with the common library functions.
