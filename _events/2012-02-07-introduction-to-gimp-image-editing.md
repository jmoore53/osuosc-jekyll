This Thursday at 7:00PM, in [Dreese Lab](http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279) room 266, Brian Swaney will be teaching us the basics of [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) image editing. This presentation primarily will focus basic tools including but not limited to [cloning](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html)/[healing](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html), [layer](http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html) [masking](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html), [fine](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html) [selections](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html), and [basic](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html) [image](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html) [transformations](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html). To demonstrate that GIMP is on the same playing field as [other proprietary and expensive image editors](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshopextended.html), some more [advanced techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s) may also be discussed if time allows. The talk is interactive, and use of a laptop with GIMP already installed is encouraged, but no prior experience with image editors is necessary. Nonetheless, the talk shall be informative for even experienced image editors.

Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.

Finally, the upcoming version of GIMP, and its progress will be discussed. If ready by the presentation, a new version will be demonstrated, and features will be explained. The overall progress of the new stable version will also be discussed, and some even newer features not released in the upcoming version will be demonstrated.
