Thursday, March 1st at 7:00PM, various club members will be presenting window managers and desktop environments for X11.  If you've never used anything but the default interface that comes with your Linux distribution and are interested in trying something new out, this should be right up your alley.  If you've got a favorite, obscure window manager and you want to help spread the word, here's your chance.

Currently, the following are more or less taken(/assigned):

| Window Manager        | Presenter(s) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
dwm | paradigm |
openbox | paradigm |
compiz | paradigm |
unity | whatsdoom |
awesome | alingo or slackbyte or whatsdoom |
KDE | alingo |
i3 | besilvereagle |
xfce4 | sifi |
xmonad | saterus |
mint's gnome fork | Embolalia |


If you know and want to show off something that isn't listed, feel free to
contact Daniel "paradigm" Thau and I'll be sure to add you to the list - or just
show up at the meeting.  No harm done if two people want to show off the same
WM/DE.
