This Thursday, September 6th at 7:00 pm in Dreese 266, Brad Hollander will be presenting the Android operating system. Android is Google's open-source mobile operating system for smartphones and tablets, built on top of a customized Linux kernel. Applications are written in Java and are compiled to be run on the Dalvik virtual machine. All are welcome and as always, there will be pizza.
