title: Introduction to Vim
---
Thursday, October 11th at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau will be presenting an introduction to the Vim text editor.  Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as, but not limited to, programming), the benefits can far outweigh the costs.

In the past, Daniel's presentations on Vim have attempted to provide benefit, for everyone from those completely new to Vim to more experienced users.  Instead, two talks on Vim will be given this time around: one for those who are new to Vim and another intended to benefit those already comfortable with Vim.  This first talk on October 11th will be solely an introduction; it will focus on the basics and be at a relatively slow pace.

Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux, as well as other platforms. If you've got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install Vim and bring it in; playing with the various aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.
