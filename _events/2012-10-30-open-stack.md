This Thursday, November 1st at 7:00PM in Dreese Labs 266, Joel Friedly will be presenting an overview of OpenStack.

OpenStack is an open source counterpart to the software behind Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, etc.). Since being started in 2010 by NASA and Rackspace Hosting, more than 150 companies have joined the project, including AMD, Intel, Canonical, SUSE Linux, Red Hat, Cisco, Dell, HP, IBM and Yahoo!. It is free open source software released under the terms of the Apache License.

Joel will be covering a technical view of OpenStack, demoing features and walking through the Python that powers them.  You can find out more about the project at http://www.openstack.org/.
