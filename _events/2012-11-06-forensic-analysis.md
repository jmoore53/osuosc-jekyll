This week's meeting will include a presentation by C. Matthew Curtin, the first faculty advisor of our club as well as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.  He is the founder of Interhack, a computer expert firm with offices in Columbus and Chicago.  With clients across North America, Interhack consults in high-stakes situations including data breaches, mission-critical system failure, and forensic analysis of computer systems and data in complex litigation.

Using examples from his own practice, Curtin will discuss the role of open source software in forensic analysis and transparency in methodology to create a record of evidence for adjudication.

He also dares you to take his Lisp class.
