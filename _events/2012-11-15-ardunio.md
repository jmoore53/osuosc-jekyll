Ryan Karason will be demonstrating open source hardware. The purpose of the lecture is to discuss the basic principles of electricity as applied to circuitry and to introduce the open hardware prototyping platform created by Arduino. If you are interested in getting involved in making your own circuits or better understanding others' circuits so you can hack them, show up this Thursday; November 15, 2012 at 7PM in 266 Dreese Laboratory.
