title: GIMP Image Editing
---
This Thursday at 7 pm, in Dreese Lab 369, Brian Swaney will teach us GIMP image editing techniques. The presentation will be interactive and encourage audience participation, so you should bring a laptop with GIMP already installed to follow along. Some techniques covered may include [cloning](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-clone.html)/[healing](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-heal.html), [layer](http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-image-combining.html) [masking](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-layer-mask-menu.html), [fine](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-using-paths-and-selections.html) [selections](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-iscissors.html), and [basic](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-rotate.html) [image](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-scale.html) [transformations](http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tool-crop.html). Some more [advanced techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtFt6axp5s) may be covered if time allows, just to show that GIMP can live up to the same standard as _other editors whose names are withheld due to trademark licensing concerns_, but no prior experience is required.

Although past presentations have focused on advanced editing, a foundational understanding of the basic tools is essential to understand those techniques. In the past, many guests saw how to perform some advanced edit, but walked away not understanding the basic tools were ultimately unable to replicate what they saw. Therefore, this talk will be aimed at somebody who has never opened GIMP before, and provide the tools necessary to discover advanced editing tricks on your own, but still contain some useful tips for professionals.

The presentation will use 2.8\. If you haven't installed GIMP yet, make sure you install 2.8, and if you have 2.6 installed, you should upgrade to 2.8 if feasible. Differences between the 2 versions will still be covered where applicable.
