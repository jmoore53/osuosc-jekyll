This Thursday, 2013/02/14 at 7pm in Dreese Labs 369, Daniel Thau will be presenting techniques to maximize battery life on a Linux laptop.  With the techniques which will be presented, it is not unusual for laptops to have battery lives that actually outlast manufacturer's advertised specifications; for example, Daniel's Lenovo x230 with a 94Wh battery tends to last upwards of 12 hours in real-world conditions.  If you *really* love your laptop, and want to show it how much you care this Valentine's day, this presentation will show you how to treat it right.
