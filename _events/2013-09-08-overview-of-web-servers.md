This Thursday, September 12, in Caldwell Labs 120, Matt Meinwald will discuss Free HTTP servers, including Apache, Lighttpd, and Nginx. He will go over some of the benefits and limitations of each, and also compare configuration. Some command-line knowledge would be helpful, but no prior web server experience is needed. You will not necessarily walk out an expert on web servers, but by the end of the meeting, you should have the resources to set up a basic web server.

Laptops are encouraged, but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
