Hey everyone,

This Saturday, November 09 at 10am until 10pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Room, the Ohio State Open Source Club will have a LAN party.

Come on out if you're interested in such games as Team Fortress 2, Teeworlds, Armegatron, and more!

We will provide infrastructure, food, and of course soda.

Hope to see you there!
