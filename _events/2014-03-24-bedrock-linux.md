title: Bedrock Linux
---
This Thursday, May 27th at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Daniel Thau and Brad Hollander will present Bedrock Linux.   Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution founded by Daniel with the aim of making most of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux distributions available simultaneously and transparently. For example, if one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch Linux), Bedrock will provide a means to achieve this.
