Thursday, April 3rd at 7:00PM in Caldwell Labs (CL) 120, Ben Rhoads will present Arduino and Open-Source Hardware. The first half of the meeting will discuss Arduino, an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple microcontroller board, and the second half of the meeting will be a PCB layout demonstration using Upverter. Upverter is the Github equivalent for circuitry. You can create a free Upverter account if you would like to follow along during the demonstration. (http://upverter.com)

As always, there will be pizza.
