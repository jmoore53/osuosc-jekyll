Thursday, 2014-09-18 at 7:00pm in Caldwell Labs 120, George Kvaratskhelia will present "Introduction to the Command Line". This talk, geared toward beginners to the world of Unix and Unix-like systems, will cover the absolute basics of getting around and being productive in your Linux environment.

Topics covered should include (but not be limited to):
- basic directory traversal
- file ownership and permissions
- file creation / deletion / rename
- basic editing

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
