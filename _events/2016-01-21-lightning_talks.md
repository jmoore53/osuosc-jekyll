meeting_date: 2016-01-21

Tonight's meeting will be drafting future talks for the semester + some
lightning talks; and I'm going to give a condensed version of a powerpoint at a
conference that I saw on Monday dealing with the economics of zero-day
vulnerabilities. Future meeting dates will posted on the website as they're
determined.

Laptops are encouraged but not required, and as always, there will be pizza.
