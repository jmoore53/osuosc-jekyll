<!-- INSERT TEXT HERE -->
Pretty Good Privacy(PGP) is a great way to communicate privately, but also to verify the identity of an online source. PGP is commonly used in fields such as journalism when identity is a must or when signing your code. PGP can also be used to encrypt communications so that only one party can read it.

Join us this Thursday, October 20, 2016, as Michael Yanovich describes the functionality of PGP and demonstrates how to use it. You'll learn how to generate your own key, and have the opportunity to partake in a key signing party!

As always, laptops are encouraged and pizza will be provided
