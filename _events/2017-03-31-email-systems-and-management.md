Join us this Thursday, April 06, at 19:00 in Dreese 264 for a talk on email.
Email is one of the oldest and widely used protocols on the internet today.
This talk will discuss how we have tried to keep it safe from scammers and
spammers while maintaining backwards compatibility. Additionally we will
discuss how modern email systems are setup and how to set up email for your own
domain.

As always there will be pizza and laptops are encouraged
