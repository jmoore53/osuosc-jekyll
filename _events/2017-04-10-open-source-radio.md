This Thursday, April 13, at 19:00 in Dreese Labs 264, join the Open Source Club and Dan Zeleznikar, Ohio State ECE alumni and current LGS Signal Processing Engineer, for an overview of open source HW/SW that can be used for radio communications transceivers, including a demo of reverse engineering the controls of an RC car. Attendees are encouraged to bring their own RC toys for experimentation as well. Feel free to bring resumes, and dinner will be provided!
