<!-- INSERT TEXT HERE -->
Join us Thursday April 20th at 19:00 in Dreese Labs 264, for a virtual reality workshop. We'll use the Aframe framework made by Mozilla VR to work through a few simple VR examples. Before we get started with our adventure into VR, we'll have a sendoff for our graduating seniors.

As always, there will be pizza and laptops are encouraged.
