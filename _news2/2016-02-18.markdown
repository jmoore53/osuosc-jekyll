        * Lecture on music copy right by Harvard Law professor William Fisher.
        * Lecture is under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
        * Fisher played a few clips of songs ranging from 15s to 45s.
        * Falls ***without question*** within the spectrum of fair abuse.
        * Irony is that RIAA, MPAA, and other copyright supporters claim the need for better education concerning copyright yet themselves are abusing copyright.

      notes: |
        * Long standing issue since 2004.
        * Mozilla owns the trademark ```Firefox``` and has the right to deny the use of the name/trademark on unofficial builds.
        * [Debian Free Software Guidelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines) determine whether something can be included in Debian releases."
        * Firefox logo did not meet guidelines.
        * GNU Iceweasel is Firefox + Debian patches and modifications

      notes: |
        * After a recent FCC decision, companies are clamping down on firmware
        * There were fears that this would prevent people from using Open Source firmware
        * FCC 'clarifies', says open source has nothing to worry about
        * TP-Link is pushing out updates that cause the router to reject unsigned firmware
        * If you update your router, you won't ever be able to go back and install Open Source firmeware
