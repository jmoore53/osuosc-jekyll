        * Lecture on music copy right by Harvard Law professor William Fisher.
        * Lecture is under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
        * Fisher played a few clips of songs ranging from 15s to 45s.

      notes: |
        * Street Fighter 5 will not ship with SteamOS/Linux support.

        * This is nice because PC gamers (especially Linux gamers) are in a somewhat uncertain state after the Warner Brothers debacle.
