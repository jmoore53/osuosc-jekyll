        * In other words, government is arguing that you do not own your iPhone ~ in some general sense, Apple does.

        > not just smartphones, will be connected to the Internet of Things, the
        > government's theory that a licensing agreement allows it to compel the
        > manufacturers of such products to help it surveil(sic) the products' users will
        > result in a virtually limitless expansion of the government's legal authority
        > to surreptitiously intrude on personal privacy.
