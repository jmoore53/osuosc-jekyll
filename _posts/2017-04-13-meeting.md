    - title: "1/2 CAB requires all CAs to check and process a domain's CAA before issuing certs"
      link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_Certification_Authority_Authorization"
      notes: |
        * CAB
          > "A voluntary consortium of certification authorities, vendors of Internet browser software, operating systems, and other PKI-enabled applications that promulgates industry guidelines governing the issuance and management of X.509 v.3 digital certificates that chain to a trust anchor embedded in such applications."
          * [CA/Browser Forum](https://cabforum.org/)
        * Certification Authority Authorization
          * [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844) standardized in 2013
          * New DNS Record (type 257)
            * Can list zero by specifying `":"`
            * Comma-separated otherwise
          * Lists CAs that are authorized to provide certs for domain 
          * Therefore it acts as a whitelist (good!)
          * Intended to strengthen PKI
            * Similar to public key pinning (HPKP)
          * CAA record checking takes about 7ms per record
        * CAA is largely an administrative control.
          * Enterprises can utilize CAA to force their organization into a uniform issuance policy thatâ€™s enforced by the CAs.
        * Clients can not force a CAA check to verify a certificate
          > "Relying Applications MUST NOT use CAA records as part of certificate validation"
          > "CAA records are intended to allow CAs to avoid mis-issuing certificates in some circumstances, while DANE records are intended to allow relying applications (TLS clients) to avoid relying on mis-issued certificates in some circumstances."
        * Proposal implementation
          * Proposal passed - March 2017
          * Proposal implement date - September 2017
        * CAA record creation is possible in the latest version of BIND, NSD, Knot, and PowerDNS.
        * [SSL Labs already supports checking for CAA](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/issues/274)
    - title: "EFF stupid patents blog under attack"
      link: "https://supporters.eff.org/civicrm/mailing/view?reset=1&id=2097"
      notes: |
        * The company GEMSA owns a patent for virtual cabinets to represent different OS and partitions
        * Recent litigation has been filed in Australia against EFF to withdraw the blog post
        * On record GEMSA has filed multiple patent infringement cases in the US
        * Law in the US (the SPEECH) act states foreign orders aren't enforceable if they go against free speech protections
        * Lawsuits have been filed by both parties, GEMSA filed with slander charges and EFF to protect their free speech
    - title: "UDP remote code execution on Linux 4.4 and below"
      link: "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10229#vulnDescriptionTitle"
      notes: |
        * UDP traffic can trigger an unsafe second checksum that allows remote code execution
        * Apparently RedHat doesn't have this exploited code in their kernel so STDLinux is safe
    - title: "Prison-made computers"
      link: "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/04/inmates-built-computers-hidden-in-ceiling-connected-them-to-prison-network/?_utm_source=1-2-2"
      notes: |
        * Inmates "made" (assembled) computers that they attached to the prison network
        * Computers were loaded with porn and articles on drugs, explosives, and more.
        * Components came from a computer recycling plant in the prison
        * Computers were transported 1100 ft through checkpoints
    - title: "Someone hacked every tornado siren in Dallas. It was loud"
      link: "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C83bG_1UIAAiU4v.jpg"
      notes: |
        * Friday, April 8, 2017
        * 18 minutes before midnight
        * For _an hour and a half_
        * 156 emergency weather sirens
        * [Map of siren locations](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C86cHfnUMAAWKkV.jpg)
        * Flummoxed officials had decided the only way to stop the noise was to
            > unplug the radio systems and the repeater, and pretty much turn the siren system completely off.
        * Officials have ruled out a remote hack
          * All indicators point to [HACKERMAN](http://i.imgur.com/BMSSPFJ.jpg)
        * The attack was via a radio signal
        * Storms are expected to roll into the region next week
